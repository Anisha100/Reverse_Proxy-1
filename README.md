# Reverse Proxy using FIDO2

Maintaining student attendance has been a problem in various educational institutions. Some has resorted to using manual attendance, 
which is very vulnerable to proxy attendances. Some are using biometric attendance systems which is not efficient and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
Under the theme of education, reverse-proxy is a web-based framework that can be used to handle student attendance in an institution 
which is more seamless than the currently used digital attendance systems. It can be used in both online education and offline 
education modes seamlessly. Our amazing and hardworking team includes Aditya Mitra, Rishita Shaw, Anisha Ghosh and Samhita.
